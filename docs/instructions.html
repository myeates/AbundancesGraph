  <body><h3>Description</h3>
<p>This tool graphs Abundance vs. Z or A as a scatter plot or a line plot.
It also outputs the raw data as text after adding abundances.
The tool takes the location, either local or on the web, of a .txt file.</p>
<p>The input file should contain 3 columns, each separated by a tab, 
with the first column containing atomic number, the second atomic mass, 
and the third abundances.</p>
<p>The example loads a .txt file from the web.</p>
